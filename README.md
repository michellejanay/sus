# Systems Usability Test

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Systems Usability Test
I am a <strong>developer running a UX Design Research Case Study</strong> who wanted to add some personal branding touches to a form survey. 
Unfortunately, like much of the inspiration I find for my other projects, there aren't very many platforms available that allow you to completely customize a form, so I decided to build one ðŸ‘€
In this project, I am learning about Google Spreadsheets API app integration to be able to see and analyse the results of the Systems Usability Scale.
This project stands out, because it uses Web Standard Best Practices, allows for easy customability, and automates the results of running a Systems Usability Scale study âœ¨

# Installation

[comment]: <> (Use the example in your original project readme)

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
